'''
Observations from chall0.c and chall1.c
Common Structure:

Both files have a similar structure, including init, print_menu, write_buffer, print_heap, and check_win functions.

Both use heap memory allocation for input_data and safe_var.

Both have a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Differences:

chall0.c checks if safe_var is not equal to "bico" to trigger the win condition.

chall1.c checks if safe_var is equal to "pico" to trigger the win condition.

The initialization strings for input_data and safe_var are the same in both files ("pico" and "bico", respectively).

Vulnerability:

Both files are vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the write_buffer function, where scanf("%s", input_data) does not limit the input size.
